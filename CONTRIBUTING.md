Keep in mind that this is a personal config, so it's highly opinionated. If you think a rule should be added or changed, feel free to create an issue or a pull request, but be aware that I will probably close it if I disagree about the change. You can always [extend this config](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files) or override its rules in your own configuration file.
